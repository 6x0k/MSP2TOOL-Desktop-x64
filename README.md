## Features

### MSP2TOOL Integration

The desktop application loads the privacy-clean MSP2TOOL 1.8.73 extension directly inside Microsoft WebView2.

This means the desktop client can provide the existing MSP2TOOL functionality without requiring a separate browser-extension installation.

Included functionality includes:

- Auto Dress Up
- Color Inspector
- PetClone
- Pet Capture / Pet-Erkennung
- Homes Harvest
- Dynamic Home Catalog
- Dynamic Emoji Pack
- StarQuiz
- DM Spam Shield
- DM Flood Lockdown
- Outfit Copy
- Outfit Restore
- Outfit Emergency
- Avatar synchronization
- Room Image Sync
- Pet Nickname
- Account-State-Cleanup
- MSP2 profile/game tools


### 1.8.73.4 Improvements
Added automatic Dress Up bot functionality with round-state handling.
Added automatic outfit selection and Dress Up event processing.
Added automatic ready, rating, replay, and round-end handling.
Added Outfit Color Codes detection and copying.
Added dedicated Dress Up and Color Codes sidebar tools.
Added integrated in-panel views without opening separate windows.
Improved Dress Up WebSocket event detection and reliability.
Improved avatar/inventory loading for Color Codes.
Improved UI integration and navigation for the new tools.

### 1.8.53 Improvements

- Added Autographer auto-repeat with configurable repeat limits and cooldowns.
- Added automatic VIP detection through the MSP2 membership API.
- Added automatic Shop Emote loading and categorization.
- Added room animation playback and animation previews.
- Added Radar functionality and improved player interaction tools.
- Added customizable panel backgrounds with persistent local storage.
- Added image upload, URL support, and automatic image compression.
- Added IndexedDB-based persistent panel background storage.
- Improved UI synchronization for custom backgrounds and animations.
- Improved animation and emote state preservation when shop data is refreshed.

### 1.8.42 Improvements

- Added persistent local D3 caching with `_readDurableD3Text` and `_writeDurableD3Text`.
- Added pack-ready notifications with `_notifyPackReady`.
- Improved background D3 preloading with `_warmD3Background`.
- Added local-first D3 pack loading with `_fetchPackText`.
- Improved local data prefetching with `xb:prefetch`.
- Added persistent D3 cache support across service-worker restarts.

The exact behavior of individual tools can depend on the current MovieStarPlanet 2 website and its APIs.

## Privacy

The desktop project is based on the privacy-clean MSP2TOOL build.

The previously identified vendor credential-vault and telemetry functionality has been removed from the clean extension, including:

- Password interception through `webRequest`
- Password storage
- External credential-vault uploads
- Account/token synchronization to the vendor
- Hardware fingerprinting
- IP collection through IPify
- Heartbeat/presence reporting
- Remote kill-switches
- Remote configuration/gating
- Remote feedback uploads
- Unnecessary third-party vendor host permissions

The desktop application itself does not implement an external account/password collection service.

### Important

The application still connects to MovieStarPlanet 2 and its required services. Those services may process information according to their own privacy policies and terms.

Only use the application with accounts and services you are authorized to use.

## Architecture

```text
MSP2TOOL Desktop
│
├── C# / .NET 8
│   └── WPF
│
├── Microsoft WebView2
│   └── Embedded Chromium browser
│
└── MSP2TOOL Extension 1.8.42
    ├── manifest.json
    ├── app.js
    ├── bg.js
    ├── boot.js
    ├── d1.json
    ├── d2.json
    └── d3.json
```

The extension is installed into the WebView2 profile using the WebView2 browser-extension API.

The application uses a persistent local WebView2 profile:

```text
%LocalAppData%\MSP2TOOL\WebView2
```

This allows normal website session data to remain available between launches.

---

## Requirements

You need:

- Windows 10 or Windows 11
- Windows x64
- .NET 8 SDK for building from source
- Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime
- Internet connection
- A MovieStarPlanet 2 account

The project uses:

```text
Microsoft.Web.WebView2
```

The application is intended for Windows desktop systems.

---

## Installation

### Option 1 — GitHub Release

If a compiled release is available:

1. Open the repository's **Releases** page.
2. Download the latest MSP2TOOL Desktop ZIP.
3. Extract the ZIP.
4. Start:

```text
MSP2TOOL.Desktop.exe
```

5. The application initializes WebView2 and opens MovieStarPlanet 2 automatically.

### WebView2

The Microsoft Edge WebView2 Runtime is required.

Most current Windows installations already have WebView2 installed. If it is missing, install the WebView2 Runtime from Microsoft before starting the application.

### Option 2 — Build it yourself

You can also build the application directly from the source code. See [Build from Source](#build-from-source).

---

## Build from Source

Clone the repository:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/6x0k/MSP2TOOL-Desktop-x64.git
cd MSP2TOOL-Desktop-x64
```

Restore the NuGet dependencies:

```powershell
dotnet restore
```

Build the project:

```powershell
dotnet build -c Release
```

For a self-contained Windows x64 application:

```powershell
dotnet publish -c Release -r win-x64 --self-contained true
```

The published application will be located in:

```text
bin\Release\net8.0-windows\win-x64\publish\
```

---

## Quick Build

A `BUILD.bat` file is included in the repository.

You can run:

```text
BUILD.bat
```

from Windows to perform the configured build/publish process.

---

## Running

After installation or publishing, start:

```text
MSP2TOOL.Desktop.exe
```

During startup, the application:

1. Initializes WebView2.
2. Enables browser-extension support.
3. Loads the local MSP2TOOL extension.
4. Creates or opens the local MSP2TOOL WebView2 profile.
5. Navigates to MovieStarPlanet 2.
6. Makes the MSP2TOOL interface available inside the application.

---

## Browser Controls

The desktop client provides basic browser controls:

- Back
- Forward
- Refresh
- Address bar
- Go
- MSP2 shortcut
- Clear WebView2 data

The address bar allows navigation to supported web pages through the embedded browser.

---

## Clearing Local Browser Data

The application includes a control for clearing the WebView2 data used by MSP2TOOL.

This can help when:

- MSP2 session data becomes corrupted
- cached website data causes problems
- the website behaves unexpectedly
- you want to start with a fresh browser profile

Clearing browser data can log you out of websites stored inside the application.

        ├── d1.json
        ├── d2.json
        └── d3.json
```

There is no requirement for an empty `Bridge` directory in the current desktop build.

Empty directories are not tracked by Git and therefore do not need to be created in the GitHub repository.

---

## Versioning

Current version:

```text
MSP2TOOL Desktop 1.8.42
```

The desktop version corresponds to the integrated MSP2TOOL extension version.

The integrated 1.8.42 extension also includes the selected safe 1.8.42 local caching and performance improvements:

- Persistent D3 cache
- Pack-ready notifications
- Improved D3 warm-up
- Local-first pack loading
- `xb:prefetch` improvements

The desktop build does not include the upstream credential interception, telemetry, vendor vault, remote gate, kill-switch, or other removed vendor functionality.


The privacy-clean desktop build intentionally does not use the original vendor's remote version gate or kill-switch system.

Future update checking can be implemented through a transparent GitHub Releases or public version-file mechanism without collecting account, token, IP, or hardware information.

---

## Security

Security and privacy are core goals of this project.

When integrating future MSP2TOOL versions, the code should be reviewed for:

- Credential interception
- Token exfiltration
- Unexpected external network requests
- Remote configuration
- Hardware fingerprinting
- IP tracking
- Hidden persistence
- Suspicious permissions
- Unauthorized data collection
- Remote execution mechanisms

New network communication should be documented and justified.

The project should not reintroduce the removed vendor credential-vault or telemetry functionality.
